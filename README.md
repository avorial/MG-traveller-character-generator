# Traveller Character Creator

A web app for generating Mongoose Traveller 2e characters through the complete lifepath system — characteristics, species, pre-career education, careers (qualify, survive, events, mishaps, advancement, aging), mustering out, psionics, and a final character sheet with capsule description.

Built as a Docker-packaged FastAPI + Jinja2 + vanilla JS stack. All rules data lives in editable JSON files — no code changes required to add a new career, species, or tweak a table.

## Running it

```bash
docker compose up
```

Open <http://localhost:8000>. That's it.

The `app/` directory is mounted as a volume — edits to JSON rule files, templates, CSS, or Python hot-reload without a rebuild. Refresh the browser (or `POST /api/reload-rules`) to pick up JSON changes.

Without Docker:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## What's implemented

### Full lifepath phases

1. **Characteristics** — Roll 2D×6 for all six stats, with optional stat swaps.
2. **Species** — Pick a species; modifiers and traits are applied automatically. Noble titles are granted to high-SOC Imperial-raised characters.
3. **Background skills** — Skill picks gated by EDU DM.
4. **Pre-career education** — Optional phase before the career loop (see below).
5. **Career loop** — Qualify → assignment → basic training → skill training → survival → event → mishap (if failed survival) → advancement → end term (aging at term 4+). Repeats for as many careers and terms as the player chooses.
6. **Mustering out** — Cash and benefit rolls from each career's table, with pension calculation for long service.
7. **Skill packages** — Optional package pick at the end of mustering out.
8. **Psionics** — Optional PSI test and talent training (available pre-career or between terms with GM permission).
9. **Finalize** — Capsule description generated, character sheet rendered, PDF/JSON export.

### Pre-career education (7 tracks)

| Track | Requirement | Duration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **University** | INT 6+ | 4 years (+2 age) | +1 EDU on enrol; graduate for +2 EDU and 2 skills at level 1; Honours adds SOC+1 and DM+1 to first qualification |
| **Military Academy** | Varies by service | 3 years (+1 age) | Service-specific qualification; graduate with Honours for automatic commission rank; full education event table |
| **Merchant Academy** | INT 9+ | 4 years (+2 age) | Business or Shipboard curriculum; graduate for +1 EDU, start Merchant/Citizen at officer rank, permanent advancement DM |
| **Colonial Upbringing** | Homeworld TL ≤ 8 (automatic) | — | Survival 1 + 10 skills at 0; graduate for END+1 and Jack-of-all-Trades 1, but EDU−D3 and permanent qualification penalties |
| **School of Hard Knocks** | SOC ≤ 6 (automatic) | — | Streetwise 1 + 2 skill picks; graduate for Gun Combat 0 + 3 more skills, but DM−2 commission in first career |
| **Spacer Community** | Homeworld size 0, INT 4+ (automatic) | 3 years | Vacc Suit 1 + 2 picks; graduate for DEX+1, Pilot 0, and permanent DM+1 to Merchant (Free Trader) advancement |
| **Psionic Community** | PSI 8+ after test | 3 years | Tests PSI on enrolment; psionic talent training; graduate for PSI+1 and permanent Psion career auto-entry |

Ineligible tracks are always visible in the picker as greyed-out cards explaining the requirement.

### Careers (all 13 fully encoded)

Every career has qualification, all assignments, full skill tables, events (2–12), mishaps (1–6), rank tracks with bonuses, and mustering-out tables.

| Career | Assignments |
|---|---|
| **Agent** | Law Enforcement, Intelligence, Corporate |
| **Army** | Support, Infantry, Cavalry |
| **Citizen** | Corporate, Worker, Colonist |
| **Drifter** | Barbarian, Wanderer, Scavenger |
| **Entertainer** | Artist, Journalist, Performer |
| **Marine** | Support, Star Marine, Ground Assault |
| **Merchant** | Merchant Marine, Free Trader, Broker |
| **Navy** | Line/Crew, Engineer/Gunner, Flight |
| **Noble** | Administrator, Diplomat, Dilettante |
| **Prisoner** | Thug, Fixer, Inmate |
| **Rogue** | Thief, Enforcer, Pirate |
| **Scholar** | Field Researcher, Scientist, Physician |
| **Scout** | Courier, Surveyor, Explorer |

### Events and mishaps — fully auto-applied

All event (2–12) and mishap (1–6) outcomes are mechanically resolved:

- Skill gains, characteristic changes, DM bonuses, and associates (allies/contacts/rivals/enemies) are applied directly to the character.
- **Dual-choice events** present a pick-one UI before continuing.
- **Life Event sub-table** (event 7 in most careers) rolls a second D6 and applies: travel, crime, illegal goods, good fortune, new contact, injury, psionic test, etc.
- **Injury Table** — interactive: when a mishap calls for an injury, the player chooses which characteristic absorbs the damage (where the rules allow a choice). Medical debt is tracked.
- **Career transfers** from events (e.g. Army 10 → Marines without qualification roll) are tracked and honoured.
- **Skill check events** (e.g. Scout event 2) apply the pass or fail branch automatically.
- **Text-only mishaps** (no mechanical effect) are flagged so the player knows nothing further needs resolving.

### Additional rules

- **Commissioning** — Army, Marine, Navy, and Noble careers prompt for a commission roll; officers start at rank 1 and use a separate rank track.
- **Draft** — Failed qualification offers a draft roll (D6 → career assignment).
- **Aging** — From term 4 onward, END/STR/DEX each roll 2D vs. their value; failures apply −1. Anagathics can be purchased to delay aging (addiction risk modelled).
- **Boon rolls** — GM-configurable pool of re-rolls; tracked per character.
- **Noble titles** — SOC 10–15 grants an Imperial title that appears on the character sheet.
- **Anagathics** — Purchase each term to slow aging; tracks addicted status.
- **Connections Rule** — Basic support: a "Connection" button lets the GM note a link to another character (skill grant from the connection is handled manually).
- **GM Mode** — Toggle to manually set every dice roll result, for testing or scripted sessions.
- **NPC generator** — `/api/character/generate-npc` produces a quick stat block without running the full lifepath.

## Extending it

### Adding a new species

Drop a file into `app/data/species/<id>.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "droyne",
  "name": "Droyne",
  "description": "An ancient, caste-based reptilian species of uncertain origin.",
  "characteristic_modifiers": {
    "STR": -2, "DEX": 0, "END": -1, "INT": 0, "EDU": 0, "SOC": 0
  },
  "characteristic_maximum": 15,
  "traits": [
    {
      "name": "Winged",
      "description": "Droyne can fly short distances in low-gravity environments."
    }
  ],
  "source": "Traveller Core Rulebook"
}
```

Refresh the browser — it appears in the species picker immediately.

### Adding or editing a career

All 13 careers are complete; use `app/data/careers/scout.json` as the reference schema. Key fields:

- `skill_tables` — `personal_development`, `service_skills`, `advanced_education`, plus one per assignment, each keyed `"1"` through `"6"`
- `ranks` — either `"default"` (one track) or per-assignment, each entry `{"title": "...", "bonus": "..."}`
- `mishaps` — keyed `"1"` through `"6"`, each a text string or structured object
- `events` — keyed `"2"` through `"12"`, with type and effect fields for auto-application
- `mustering_out` — keyed `"1"` through `"7"`, each `{"cash": <credits>, "benefit": "<name>"}`
- `"complete": true` — marks the career as fully playable

### Adding a new pre-career track

Edit `app/data/tables/education.json` to add a new entry under `"tracks"`. The engine reads enrollment skills, graduation benefits (stat gains, skills, permanent DMs), and event table references from this file. For complex multi-round skill picks or conditional eligibility, add a handler branch in `app/engine/lifepath.py → pre_career_qualify()`.

## Character state

The `Character` object is the single source of truth. It lives in `localStorage`, travels with every API call, and is returned updated. Key fields of note:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `phase` | Current creation phase (`characteristics` → `species` → `background` → `pre_career` → `career` → `mustering` → `finalize` → `done`) |
| `pre_career_status` | Transient state during pre-career enrollment (track, stage, skill pool, event roll, etc.) |
| `pre_career_permanent_dms` | Permanent DMs granted by pre-career education (qualification, commission, advancement, auto-rank, etc.) |
| `current_term` | The in-progress career term |
| `term_history` | Every completed term with skills gained, events, survival, advancement |
| `completed_careers` | Summary record per career |
| `pending_life_event_choice` | Populated when a life event needs player input; cleared by `/life-event-choice` |
| `pending_injury_choice` | Populated when the player must choose which stat absorbs injury damage |
| `pending_career_mishap_choice` | Populated when a mishap requires player input |
| `forced_next_career_id` | Set by events/education that mandate a specific next career |
| `pending_transfer_career_id` | Career transfer offer from an event; consumed on next qualification |
